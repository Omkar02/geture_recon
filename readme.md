![Gestures](/Images/readme_img.jpg)

Our goal is to design an application that will use a webcam(or an external camera) as an input device and it will then identify and classify the gesture into one of the categories that we are going to define.

This also give flexiblity to map the gesture to user defined words or sentences!
